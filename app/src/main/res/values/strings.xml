    <string name="launch_disclaimer">As mobile apps become more and more prevalent day to day, we are continually finding new and interesting methods of using these apps to improve our everyday lives. Cork City has had a history of being subject to many flooding events and this project aims to provide a solution to flooding prediction systems that are currently in place using live databases of information, statistics and machine learning. Utilizing these technologies, the project aims to provide users with an easy to use mobile app to get real time, up to date flooding predictions for the Cork City and greater region using live and historical river data. This is all supported by a large and growing database of information related to flooding analysis such as river levels, temperature, tidal levels and more.</string>
