    <string name="launch_disclaimer">As mobile apps become more and more prevalent day to day, we are continually finding new and interesting methods of using these apps to improve our everyday lives. Cork City has had a history of being subject to many flooding events and this project aims to provide a solution to flooding prediction systems that are currently in place using live databases of information, statistics and machine learning. Utilizing these technologies, the project aims to provide users with an easy to use mobile app to get real time, up to date flooding predictions for the Cork City and greater region using live and historical river data. This is all supported by a large and growing database of information related to flooding analysis such as river levels, temperature, tidal levels and more.</string>

    <string name="disclaimerText">The information presented by Leeway should not be used as a definitive estimation or prediction of flooding in the Cork City and surrounding area. Predictions are an approximation based on a variety of data to the best of our ability and should be used in unison with other sources of river level information and forecasts. All river level and flooding predictions are based around the river sensor located on the river at Sundayâ€™s Well, Cork.</string>
